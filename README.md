# **Hi, I'm Sasha!**
#### I’m a 4rth year student of the Applied Computer Science faculty at Jagiellonian University. If I could only describe myself in one word it would have to be a “passion”. I immerse myself in what I love but I also have a balanced approach to what I’m doing. I’m trying to deepen my knowledge and improve my skills all the time. 
#### As for me, recipe for success is: **passion + cold mind + persistence** :)
